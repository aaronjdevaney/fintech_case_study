## __Overview and Origin__

NICE Ltd., ("NICE") is a software company incorporated in Israel that was originally called Neptune Intelligent Computer Engineering Ltd. The original business purpose of NICE at the time it was founded in 1986 was to digitize unstructured data that was being captured using analog means. NICE is publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and has issued ADR shares that trade on NASDAQ. In 2007, NICE acquired Actimize Ltd. ("Actimize"), another Israeli company for approximately $281 million and in so doing, entered the Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") compliance and analytics space with the acquisition of Actimize's technology. Actimize was founded in 1999 by David Sosna to provide insight into the behavior of customers and employees of financial institutions. Today, Actimize exists as a wholly-owned subsidiary of NICE. The AML compliance and analytics tool that was developed by Actimize and acquired by NICE is known as NICE Actimize and is distributed by NICE Systems Inc. in the United States.  

## __RegTech Domain__

The space in which NICE Actimize competes is known as RegTech and it is populated by a mix of startups like Beam and more established companies such as BAE Systems and NICE Actimize itself. These companies are utilizing technology to meet growing regulatory compliance challenges imposed on financial institutions after the financial crisis and the Bernie Madoff scandal.

According to a report by PwC, it is expected that RegTech adoption will expand rapidly as interest in cutting costs in AML compliance becomes more of a priority for financial institutions. Additionally, PwC noted that many of the current RegTech startups offer narrowly tailored solutions while large financial institutions are in the market for comprehensive solutions; therefore, it is expected that RegTech will go through a period of consolidation. NICE Actimize has already gone through that phase when NICE acquired Actimize in 2007. 

Although NICE has a wide array of products and solutions ranging from fraud prevention to physical security, the focus of this case study is on its AML offerings, and more specifically, its transaction monitoring solution.

## __NICE Actimize__

NICE Actimize provides a comprehensive solution for financial institutions that is comprised of several modules that address the various aspect of financial crimes compliance such as:

* Customer Due Diligence
* Watch List Filtering
* Currency Transaction Reports
* Suspicious Activty Reporting  

Importantly, NICE Actimize provides a Suspicious Activity Monitoring (SAM) solution that uses technology such as AI, machine learning and robotic process automation to generate accurate and productive alerts for potentially suspicious financial transactions. In addition to its technology, the tool utilizes human expertise to enhance its product.  NICE Actimize has a library of suspicious transaction models that can be used to identify common AML scenarios as well as other financial crimes scenarios. The tool also provides functionality allowing a financial institutions to fine tune scenarios to its specific needs in order to address areas of particular risk or to eliminate unproductive alerts.

## __The Problem that NICE Actimize Aims to Solve__

Regulatory compliance and especially AML compliance is increasingly expensive for financial institutions. The expenses stem from incresing headcount to avoid a regulatory fine or facing a fine running into the millions or the staffing needed to prevent running afoul of the regulators. For example, in 2019, US regulators imposed 25 fines on financial institutions totaling $2.29 billion. Against such a backdrop, financial institutions are being forced to generate a massive amount of transaction alerts in order to manage their risk of being fined for AML violations.

Furthermore, for banks regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, they are required by DFS rule 504 to have a transaction monitoring system such as NICE Actimize.

## __How NICE Actimize Uses Technology to Address the Problem__

As discussed above, NICE Actimize utilizes AI, machine learning and robotic process automation in its transaction monitoring tool. These technologies allow a financial institution utilizing NICE Actimize to reduce headcount in the AML department. The advantages conferred by the tool are:

* Accurately detect money laundering scenarios based on a bank's risk profile
* Present high-quality alerts to analysts
* Automate administrative tasks

## __Competition__

Some of NICE Actimize's competitors are:

* Alessa
    * provides an integrated solution with due diligence, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring and regulatory reporting
* Oracle Financial Services Anti Money Laundering
    * detects, investigates and reports suspected money laundering activity
* Beam
    * monitor transactions, detect suspicious activity, manage investigations and file suspicious activity reports

## __Strategy and the Future__

According to NICE's 2019 Annual Report, its "strategy is to further strengthen our leadership position in both Customer Engagement and Financial Crime and Compliance market segments, as well as further enhance our position in adjacent markets."  It also intends to use the following strategies as they related to technology: 

* Cloud Transformation by facilitating customer adoption of cloud services
* Digital Transformation by serving customers across multiple channels
* Analytics, AI and Automation Transformation expertise in advanced technologies as differentiating factors

## __Conclusion__

As the RegTech industry rapidly expands to meet the growing the regulatory and financial challenges facing financial institutions, it appears the NICE Actimize is well-positioned to maintain its position among the leaders in the domain. NICE Actimize utilizes advances technologies and is able to address the most important needs in this area--risk management and cost reductions.  Based on recommendations from firms such as PwC, it appears that NICE Actimize's future strategy is sound as it is primarily focusing on technology to advance its business. Nice Actimize is already positioned among the top companies in the RegTech domain because it has already gone through a consolidation and is able to offer a complete AML compliance solution.
